 ## Basic Control Flow
 ### Challenge 1: Find the error
 Whatâ€™s wrong with the following code?
 
 ```
 let firstName = "Matt"
 
 if firstName == "Matt" {
   let lastName = "Galloway"
 } else if firstName == "Ray" {
   let lastName = "Wenderlich"
 }
 let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName
 ```

 ### Challenge 2: Boolean challenge
 In each of the following statements, what is the value of the Boolean `answer` constant?
 
 ```
 let answer1 = true && true
 let answer2 = false || false
 let answer3 = (true && 1 != 2) || (4 > 3 && 100 < 1)
 let answer4 = ((10 / 2) > 3) && ((10 % 2) == 0)
 ```

 ### Challenge 3: Snakes and ladders
 Imagine you're playing a game of snakes & ladders that goes from position 1 to position 20. On it, there are ladders at position 3 and 7 which take you to 15 and 12 respectively. Then there are snakes at positions 11 and 17 which take you to 2 and 9 respectively.

 Create a constant called `currentPosition` which you can set to whatever position between 1 and 20 which you like. Then create a constant called `diceRoll` which you can set to whatever roll of the dice you want. Finally, calculate the final position taking into account the ladders and snakes, calling it `nextPosition`.

 ### Challenge 4: Number of days in a month
 Given a year reprsented by an `Int` and a month represented by a `String` in all lowercase and using the first three letters, calculate the number of days in the month. You need to account for leap years remembering that February ("feb") has 29 days in a leap year and 28 otherwise. A leap year occurs every 4 years, unless the year is divisible by 100, but then if it's divisible by 400 then it is actually a leap year.
